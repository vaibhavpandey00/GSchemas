			<div style="margin-left:90px; display:none;" id="Mydiv2">


				As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a specific scheme called the "Bureau of Water Use
				Efficiency" in India. However, the Government of India has initiated various programs and schemes aimed
				at promoting water conservation, management, and efficiency across the country. One such initiative is
				the National Water Mission (NWM), which is one of the eight missions under the National Action Plan on
				Climate Change.

				The National Water Mission (NWM) was launched in 2011 with the objective of conserving water, minimizing
				wastage, and ensuring its efficient use. While the NWM doesn't specifically mention a "Bureau of Water
				Use Efficiency," it focuses on enhancing water use efficiency across various sectors, including
				agriculture, industry, urban areas, and rural communities.

				Here are some key components and objectives of the National Water Mission:<br><br>
				1. Promotion of Water Use Efficiency: The mission aims to promote the efficient use of water resources
				across different sectors by adopting technologies and practices that minimize wastage and maximize
				productivity.<br>
				2. Increasing Water Availability: It focuses on augmenting water supply through measures such as
				rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and watershed management.<br>
				3. Enhancing Water Security: The mission aims to enhance water security by promoting sustainable water
				management practices and ensuring equitable access to water resources.<br>
				4. Awareness and Capacity Building: It emphasizes the importance of awareness and capacity building
				among stakeholders to encourage water conservation and efficient water use practices.<br>
				5. Data Collection and Monitoring: The NWM emphasizes the need for robust data collection, monitoring,
				and assessment of water resources to support evidence-based decision-making and policy formulation.<br>

				While there may not be a specific scheme named "Bureau of Water Use Efficiency," the objectives of
				various government initiatives, including the National Water Mission, align with the promotion of water
				use efficiency and conservation in India. It's essential to stay updated with the latest government
				announcements and policies to understand the full scope and details of such initiatives.<br><br>

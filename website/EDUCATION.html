		<div style="margin-left:90px; display:none;" id="Mydiv4">

			Duration<br><br>
			Amount<br><br>
			The Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) is one of the most significant interventions in the realm of education and
			nutrition in India. Here are its key features:<br><br>

			1. Free Meals: The scheme provides free, nutritious meals to children in government and government-aided
			schools, including those run under Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) and Alternative & Innovative Education
			(AIE) centers.<br>

			2. Universal Coverage: It covers children from primary to upper primary classes, typically aged between 6
			and 14 years, in both urban and rural areas.<br>

			3. Nutritional Standards: The meals provided under the scheme are designed to meet the nutritional standards
			laid down by the government, ensuring that children receive adequate nourishment for their physical and
			cognitive development.<br>

			4. Encourages Attendance: By providing free meals, the scheme aims to increase school attendance and
			retention rates, particularly among children from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.<br>

			5. Local Community Involvement: The scheme encourages the involvement of local communities, such as
			self-help groups, parents, and voluntary organizations, in the preparation and serving of meals. This not
			only helps in efficient implementation but also fosters community participation in education.<br>

			6. Focus on Quality and Hygiene: There is an emphasis on maintaining quality and hygiene standards in the
			preparation, storage, and serving of meals to ensure the safety and well-being of the children.<br>

			7. Provision of Infrastructure: In many cases, the scheme includes provisions for the construction of
			kitchen-cum-stores, procurement of cooking devices, and other infrastructure required for meal preparation.<br>

			8. Supplementary Nutrition: In addition to cooked meals, the scheme also provides supplementary nutrition in
			the form of fruits, eggs, milk, etc., to enhance the nutritional value of the meals.<br>
